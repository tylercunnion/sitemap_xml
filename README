SitemapXml
==========

SitemapXml is a simple plugin for generating XML sitemaps which can be
submitted to search engines. For more information on the Sitemap protocol,
visit http://sitemaps.org. 

To include a Sitemap in your app, first run the generator:

<tt>script/generate sitemap</tt>

This will install the SitemapController and the Sitemap view. Then add a route
for sitemap.xml to your config/routes.rb:

<tt>map.sitemap 'sitemap.xml', :controller => "sitemap", :action => "index", :format => "xml"</tt>

Now the plugin is ready to use. At the bottom of each controller you want to
include in the map, call the +enable_sitemap+ method. Check the documentation
for +enable_sitemap+ for the available options.

Restrictions
============

Please note the restrictions on Sitemap size: all maps must be less than 10MB
and contain 50,000 or fewer URIs. For an app of that size I recommend a custom
solution rather than this plugin.

= SitemapXml

v0.2 - March 10, 2009

SitemapXml is a simple plugin for generating XML Sitemaps which can be
submitted to search engines. For more information on the Sitemap protocol,
visit http://sitemaps.org.

== Installation

Install the plugin from github:
	
	ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/tylercunnion/sitemap_xml.git

To include a Sitemap in your app, first run the generator:

	script/generate sitemap

This will install the SitemapController and the Sitemap view. Then add a route
for sitemap.xml to your config/routes.rb:

	map.sitemap 'sitemap.xml', :controller => "sitemap", :action => "index", :format => "xml"

== Usage

The SitemapXml module needs to be included in every controller you want to map.
The easiest way to do this is to include SitemapXml in ApplicationController.
Alternatively, you could include SitemapXml in each individual controller.
At the bottom of each controller you want to include in the map, call the
enable_sitemap method. Please note that it must come *after* the controller's
actions, or else it will not work. There are many options for enable_sitemap,
check the documentation (+rake doc:plugins+) for a complete list.

== Restrictions

Please note the restrictions on Sitemap size: all maps must be less than 10MB
and contain 50,000 or fewer URIs. For an app of that size I recommend a custom
solution rather than this plugin.
